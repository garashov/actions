        uses: actions/checkout@v2           # actions/checkout is github <owner>/<repository> while @v2 specifies the tag(version) of the reffered github action. Instead of version it is possbile to specify also the hash(id) of the release commit, for instance: @5a4ac90. Another way of refference is branch as well.
